# Project Rules

## Operator Installation
- Every operator MUST be installed in its own dedicated namespace
- Never install multiple operators into a shared namespace (e.g., `openshift-operators`)
- For each operator, create: (1) a dedicated Namespace, (2) an OperatorGroup, (3) the Subscription — all in that namespace
